            <p class="lead">Have you ever had to work on project with multiple people? Perhaps writing a paper or composing a PowerPoint. This may have been difficult to complete if there was only one hard copy of the document. However, what if there was a way for everyone to work on the document at the same time on their separate devices? This is possible with version control system! The VCS is one repository that allows for access to multiple users and the ability for them to make, track, revert and merge changes to a file. An application that we are using in class, GitHub is a great example of a version control system. It allows us to pull data from GitHub's remote repository and store it on our devices, known as a local repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The easiest version control system to use is the local because it is simply copying the files you want and putting them into another directory. However, with the process of moving your files, it is also easier to place them in the wrong location. A further advanced system is Centralized Version Control and this consists of one server that contains the versioned files or "snapshots" and can be accessed by many people on the server. With having only one server, if it happens to go down there is no ability for anyone to access files on that server or save them. If this happens then everything that wasn't backed up is lost. So, the recommended system to use is the Distributed Version Control System, which runs in real time while changes are being made to a file. This system also automatically backups "snapshots" of files that were edited.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As mentioned previously, Git is a specific software that is a Version Control System. It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds when he, himself was not satisfied by the performance of other available systems. With a better system in mind, he managed to create one with many benefits including, speed, simplicity, capacity and much more. Git itself has the ability to track complete history of a file. Unlike other version control systems Git, has a different way of storing information. While others store changes to files as a list, Git stores these changes as snapshots and if the file has not changed then Git doesn't store the same file.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When you are working on a Git project there are a few stages and commands to remember in order to successfully complete it. When you are working on a file you are "modifying" meaning that you have made an edit but not yet saved it to your database. This process is done within the working tree, which pulls files out of Git directory so you can modify. Within the staging area is where you "stage" your file which means to flag an edited file for it to go to the next commit snapshot. Finally, when saving data onto your local database, this is called "committing" and takes your file from staging area to Git directory. file is modified it means that you have not committed a file that you have recently changed.The first state of Git is "commit", which is a command that will store your data onto your local database.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first step to initializing a repository in existing directory is to use the command, “git init” and all of your repository files will be contained in a subdirectory named “.git”. In order to track the files you want, you command “git add” following “git commit”. Need to clone an existing repository? Well you guessed it, it's as easy as stating the command, "git clone". When commanding this, the Git repository will load all the data from the server including the full history of this project. If the repository that you want to clone is a link then the command entered will be “git clone <url>”. </p>
